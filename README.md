Multi-Level Feedback Approach for Class Integration Test Order

This tool is implemented to generate the class integration test order (CITO) with the minimal stubbing efforts. It consists of three modules: static analysis, cost matrix initialization and CITO generation.
It uses a multi-level feedback strategy to calculate test profit for each class, and according to test profit, proposes a reward and punishment mechanism to assess the performance of class and set its test priority.
